# Array_Manipulations
This is practicing on Array's that I am implementing using the spread operator and also Array.prototype.every() methods as I show you how to use them in a 
particular fashion that should be relateable for you to use inside your code.

For this exercise/practice I would copy this code into VS Code or whatever your favorite IDE is and use the debugger in the IDE to run the program using Node.js 
to run the file. You should get the output which is in comments toward the bottom of the code on each respective program throughout this Array_Manipulations repository.

Thank you for viewing my repository! More Manipulations & Practicing to come soon!
